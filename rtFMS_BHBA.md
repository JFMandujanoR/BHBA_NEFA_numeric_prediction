# rtFMS Outcome for BHBA

Here we can find a [histogram](https://github.com/JFMandujanoR/QCheck_Prediction_Report/blob/master/Hist_Binary_Bal_Acc_GLMNET_BHBA.png) of balanced accuracy after running all the options.

The [graph](https://github.com/JFMandujanoR/QCheck_Prediction_Report/blob/master/Tree_Binary_Bal_Acc_GLMNET_BHBA.png) shows us that the we have two best models with similar permance:

- Variable: IR
- Either of Standardization: FD, SD, FD.EMR, SD.EMR
- EMR_standardization: EMR.STAND

And: 

- Variable: IR
- Either of Standardization: FD, SD, FD.EMR, SD.EMR
- EMR_standardization: EMR.NONE

Note: The other variables do not appear in this conclusions because their elections among their options are not significant for the final result.
